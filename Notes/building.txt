Each Node directory needs two files for colcon to build 
a CMakeLists.txt and a package.xml

CMakeLists.txt: Provides compilation instructions for the compiler
package.xml: Tells information about the node such as
 - Other nodes it depends on
 - Build dependencies
 - Executable Dependencies
 - What build tool to use (ament_cmake in most cases)




colcon build: Builds entire project: 
**Checks for edited files and builds ones that need it** 



colcon build --packages-select "Node": Builds individual nodes
Ex. colcon build --packages-select communication
